# Dream11
This is a football fantasy league game developed using C#. The front end is solely developed in C#. The backend is linked to a database using Microsoft SQL Server. This was made as a university project for the course Database Systems. The real purpose was to link the application with a database and write appropriate queries to make it functional and playable. The database is also provided which can be directly imported into Microsoft SQL Server.
